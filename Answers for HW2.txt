3.6
a) fixed point:
The space between points becomes smaller as they approach to the fixed point.
limit circle:
The points overlaps to form several points and but they may not converge to some point.
Chaos
The points are randomly positioned. All poinstion range can be filled with points.
b) the changing point to chaos should be the right intersection point of the hole and line x=(r-1)/r
r is approximately 3.6

4.3
At first, accuracy gets better because the linear fit to the slope gets more precise as the 
interval of two points gets smaller. But as the interval gets too small, the round error plays 
a more important role to the precision.
